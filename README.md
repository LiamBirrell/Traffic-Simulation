# Traffic-Simulation

## WORK IN PROGRESS

A Python-based traffic simulation using array-based queuing and Gurobi optimization to minimize congestion in theoretical high-density intersections.



TO-DO:

* Fix integer split between entry and exit assignments
* add timeslot allocations
* build the vehicle dictionary for the actual simulation

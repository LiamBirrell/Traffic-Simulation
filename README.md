# Traffic-Simulation

## WORK IN PROGRESS

A Python-based traffic simulation using array-based queuing and Gurobi optimization to minimize congestion in theoretical high-density intersections.



TO-DO:

* Model up the simulation
* ensure routes are met with viable connections
* work on implementing merging methods
* TBD

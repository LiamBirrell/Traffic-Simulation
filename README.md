# Traffic-Simulation

## WORK IN PROGRESS

A Python-based traffic simulation using array-based queuing and Gurobi optimization to minimize congestion in theoretical high-density intersections.



TO-DO:

* Add exits to connection raods
* exit probabilities (weights)
* script to generate dictionary for vehicles: Time vehicle enters, where it enters, where it exits.
